#### Reproducible Demo

<!--
  Please share a project that reproduces the issue.  There are two ways to do
  it:

    * Create a new app using https://snack.expo.io/ and try to reproduce the
      issue in it.  This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is,
      or can’t share the real code.

    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal
      reproducible demo.  This is useful for finding the root cause. You may
      then optionally create a Snack.

  This is a good guide to creating bug demos:
  https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve Once you’re done, copy and paste the
  link to the Snack or a public GitHub repository below:

(Paste the link to an example project or paste the entirety of the relevant
source code. When deemed appropriate, provide instructions to reproduce the
issue.)
